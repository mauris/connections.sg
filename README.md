connections.sg
==============

connections.sg came into life sometime during Mar 2011 after the realisation that even though Singapore is a really small country with an even smaller startup ecosystem, people still generally had a difficult time finding the right connections â€“ to people, spaces and resources. 

I built it on drupal with custom fields and RSS thinking it would be easier to maintain. I was wrong. 

People, especially the ones new to Singapore, found it as a valuable resource regardless of the state. It is a very simple initiative that have saved people time, so I implore you to think of other initiatives that can do the same. [Simple -> ripple effect](https://medium.com/changing-the-world-with-lines-of-code/f01c677b630f). 

So three years later on Mar 2014 I have ported it into Github which will make it much simpler to maintain via Markdown. Please feel free to send pull requests, though please be mindful of the fact that I have deliberately kept it concise and neutral.
